"""
This program was written for the Li-Polymer Hat (SW6106) to get
data from the Shield over I2C protocol. This code is for analyzing:

1. The voltage of the battery attached to the HAT.
2. The Temperature of the built-in NTC of the HAT.
3. Any hardware related issues received by the IRQ Pin.

Extra information regarding:

2. Received value of the Temperature corresponds to the ADC Value and must be checked with Datasheet for further information.
3. Hardware related issue is received as a 1 byte binary value. If any bit is 1 this means an issue according to the bit position.

-To the HAT:

* I2C adress: 0x3C
* Register adresses for Battery: 0x14, 0x15
* Register adresses for temperature: 0x1B, 0x1C
* Register adress for IRQ-received issues: 0x0A
